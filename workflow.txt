This is the place where I will write the workflow and all the logic of the application

1.Actual workflow step by step

 =>Admin side 
  -Creates admin account using a token that is sent specifically to the admin or else login if there is an existing account.
  -Take the admin to the dashboard page
  -The admin (eg the deputy headteacher or the headteacher) should be able to upload the actual timetable in form of pdf doc
  -Should check for overlaps and conflicts on the timetable by comparing lesson times for the same teacher, classroom, or subject on the same day, and flag any time intervals that intersect.
  -Should also be able to create the actual timetable in the application if there is none in hardcopy
  -Schema : LessonsSchema :
    ```
    teacher-code: String
    Subject: String
    TimeStart: Time
                Classroom : String 
                Day : String
    Day: String
    ```
   -Should be able to view the full timetable as a table
   -Should be able to update the timetable in case of need for future changes
   -Should be able to delete the whole timetable if need be
     -Should be able to see the lessons that are underway as of that time (so as to make teacher finding easier)
